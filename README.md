Launcher-Android
---------------------
A small Android application to serve as a launcher/testbed for the Readium SDK. 

How to get source from github
-------------------------------
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/readium/Launcher-Android.git

How to build
------------
`cd readium-sdk/Platform/Android`

`./ndk-compile.sh build <your-ndk-path>`

Note: In theory, one should be able to define ANDROID_NDK (as I have) and skip the path part, but that doesn't work.

How to open eclipse project

- Launch ADT (the branded version of Eclipse, Build: v22.0.1-685705) or Eclipse with ADT plugin(s) installed
- Import the project in the SDKLauncher-Android folder
- Created a new run configuration with:
    - The launch action: `org.readium.sdklauncher_android.MainActivity`
    - Target: Nexus Emulator, Android 4.2.2 API Level 17 armeabi-v7a (or other emulator or device you have)
- Ensure that there is something for the app to open
    - Open the emulator in the Android Virtual Device manager (AVD) (in Eclipse it is in Window/Android Virtual Device Manager)
    - Edit the emulator 
        - If there isn't one then add one with the Newâ€¦ button
    - Check that the sdcard has some storage (e.g. 512 MB).  By default there isn't any
    - Open an Android shell:
        - `adb shell`
        - `mkdir epubtest`
        - Copy one or more files there:
        - `adb push <local folder/file> <device folder>`, e.g.
            - `adb push epub30-spec-20121128.epub /sdcard/epubtest`
- Run the new run configuration (above)
- This should bring up the app and show you your file(s) to open.
